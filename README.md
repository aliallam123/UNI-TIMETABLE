# UNI TIMETABLE

This repository contains an `.ics` file of my university timetable for the academic year 2024/2025. The schedule includes weekly lectures, seminars, workshops, and labs. The `.ics` format is compatible with most calendar applications, making it easy for anyone to import and manage their academic schedule.

## HOW TO SET UP

### Step 1: Download the `.ics` File
You can download the `.ics` file directly by [clicking here](https://github.com/aliallam123/UNI-TIMETABLE/blob/main/uni-timetable.ics).

### Step 2: Import to Your Calendar
- **iPhone/iOS**: Email the `.ics` file to yourself and open it on your phone. It will prompt you to add the events to your calendar.
- **Google Calendar**: 
  1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com).
  2. Click the gear icon in the top right and select **Settings**.
  3. In the left-hand menu, click **Import & Export**.
  4. Under "Import", upload the `.ics` file.
  5. Choose the calendar to add the events to, and click **Import**.
- **Outlook**: Open the `.ics` file directly with Outlook, and it will automatically import the events.
- **Other Calendar Apps**: Most calendar apps (like macOS Calendar or Thunderbird) allow importing `.ics` files by dragging the file into the app or using the import function.
